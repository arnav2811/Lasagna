Best Vegetable Lasagna
Seriously the best vegetable lasagna recipe! This vegetarian lasagna is packed with fresh veggies and spinach. #vegetarian #lasagna #veggies
I set out to create the best vegetable lasagna recipe. Here it is! This vegetarian lasagna is cheesy (of course), and loaded with vegetables, spinach and a simple tomato sauce.

If you have any meatless-meal skeptics in your life, this lasagna will change their mind. I’m sure of it.
Yet, I wanted to offer a classic vegetable lasagna suitable for holidays and weeknights, and this is it. The tomato sauce is the same across all three recipes, but the vegetables vary.

For this recipe, you’ll chop bell pepper, zucchini and carrot into very small pieces and sauté them until they’re nice and golden on the edges. That caramelization brings out so much more flavor. Then, add spinach to the skillet and cooked it down for a few minutes so it doesn’t get too soggy.

This lasagna is based on my spinach artichoke lasagna on the blog and the roasted eggplant lasagna in my cookbook. I love those less-conventional vegetarian lasagnas.

The Best Vegetable Lasagna
Five reasons to love this recipe:

You can easily adjust the vegetables to suit the seasons or your pantry (see recipe notes).
The sauce is made from scratch with basic ingredients. It only takes a few minutes to make.
Use no-boil noodles and you don’t have to bother cooking them. Just layer them up!
I recommend cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which has more protein and flavor (trust me).
You can even make this recipe gluten free and/or vegan. See the recipe notes for details.
The end result is a super flavorful, nutrient-dense, veggie-packed lasagna. This lasagna might not be the quickest weeknight option around, but it is a reasonably simple recipe that will absolutely satisfy your comfort food cravings.
